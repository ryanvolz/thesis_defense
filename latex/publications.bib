  abstract = {We present an improved technique for calculating bulk densities of
	low-mass (\&lt;1 g) meteoroids using a scattering model applied to
	the high-density plasma formed around the meteoroid as it enters
	Earth’s atmosphere. These plasmas, referred to as head echoes, travel
	at or near the speed of the meteoroid, thereby allowing the determination
	of the ballistic coefficient (mass divided by physical cross-section),
	which depends upon speed and deceleration. Concurrently, we apply
	a scattering model to the returned signal strength of the head echo
	in order to correlate radar-cross-section {(RCS)} to plasma density
	and meteoroid mass. In this way, we can uniquely solve for the meteoroid
	mass, radius and bulk density independently. We have applied this
	new technique to head echo data collected in 2007 and 2008 simultaneously
	at {VHF} (160 {MHz)} and {UHF} (422 {MHz)} at {ALTAIR}, which is
	a high-power large-aperture radar located on the Kwajalein Atoll.
	These data include approximately 20,000 detections with dual-frequency,
	dual-polarization, and monopulse (i.e. angle) returns. From 2000
	detections with the smallest monopulse errors, we find a mean meteoroid
	bulk density of 0.9 g/cm3 with observations spanning almost three
	orders of magnitude from 0.01 g/cm3 to 8 g/cm3. Our results show
	a clear dependence between meteoroid bulk density and altitude of
	head echo formation, as well as dependence between meteoroid bulk
	density and {3D} speed. The highest bulk densities are detected at
	the lowest altitudes and lowest speeds. Additionally, we stipulate
	that the approximations used to derive the ballistic parameter, in
	addition to neglecting fragmentation, suggest that the traditional
	ballistic parameter must be used with caution when determining meteoroid
	parameters.},

  abstract = {Compressed sensing, a method which relies on sparsity to reconstruct
	signals with relatively few measurements, provides a new approach
	to processing radar signals that is ideally suited to detailed imaging
	and identification of multiple targets. In this paper, we extend
	previously published theoretical work by investigating the practical
	problems associated with this approach. In deriving a discrete linear
	radar model that is suitable for compressed sensing, we discuss what
	the discrete model can tell us about continuously defined targets
	and show how sparsity in the latter translates to sparsity in the
	former. We provide details about how this problem can be solved when
	using large data sets. Through comparisons with matched filter processing,
	we validate our compressed sensing technique and demonstrate its
	application to meteors, where it has the potential to answer open
	questions about processes like fragmentation and flares. At the cost
	of computational complexity and an assumption of target sparsity,
	the benefits over pulse compression using a matched filter include
	no filtering sidelobes, noise removal, and higher possible range
	and Doppler frequency resolution.},
